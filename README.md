# linear_algebra
Proposed C++ standardisation for linear algebra

WIP so far, using MSVC 15.7.5. Right now, I'm trying to work out how I can get the transpose function to work. Why is this so vexing?

To see the problem, uncomment the assert around the call to transpose(m3) in test.cpp at line 67. All assistance welcome!
